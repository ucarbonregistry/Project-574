Waste Heat Recovery based captive power generation by SKS Ispat Ltd

Region: Raipur

Village: Siltara

District: Raipur

State: Chhattisgarh

Scale of the project activity Large Scale

Project participants Project Proponent: Sks Ispat & Power Ltd

Host Party India

Applied methodologies and standardized baselines Methodology Applied follows UNFCCC CDM
Methodologies:
ACM0012 Waste Energy Recovery Version 6.0
CATEGORY- ACM0012 Large-scale Consolidated Methodology Waste energy recovery Version
06.0

The consolidated methodology is applicable to project activities implemented in an existing or
Greenfield waste energy generation (WEG) facility converting waste energy carried in identified
waste energy carrying medium (WECM) stream(s) into useful energy (i.e. power, mechanical or
thermal) consumed in an existing or Greenfield recipient facility(ies) and/or supplied to the grid in
the case of electricity generation. The WEG facility may be one of the recipient facilities.

SKS Ispat Limited (SKSIL) has set up an integrated sponge iron plant of 2,10,000 MT capacity at
Village Siltara, district Raipur, Chattisgarh.
There are 2 X 350 TPD Kiln and 2 X 100 TPD Kiln installed for sponge iron production. Waste gas
coming out from 2x350TPD DRI Kilns and 2x100TPD DRI Kilns are recovered through 2x38 TPH
and 2x12 TPH Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRBs) respectively. Combined capacity of all 04
WHRBs produces about 25 MW of Electrical Power. Harnessing this Power by establishing a
suitably designed Captive Power Plant at the tail end of the 4 numbers of DRI Kilns enables SKSIL
to be self-reliant in the arena of Power requirement for production of Steel and to reduce emissions
of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by displacing grid power use as the case was prior
project activity which is primarily fossil fuel based.

Each 350 TPD DRI Kiln for Sponge Iron production emits normally around 90000 Nm3
/hour of hot
gas (temperature of 950-1000°C) that contains heat energy of ~29,000,000 kcal/hour which, if not
suitably utilized, goes to waste. Similarly exit gas flow for each 100 TPD kiln is around 30000
Nm3
/hour at around 950°C that contains heat energy ~9,000,000 Kcal/hour.
The DRI Gas, as it comes out of the After Burning Chamber, contains sufficient quantity of HeatEnergy. This energy waste could be abated by installing Waste Heat Recovery Boiler at the tail
end of each DRI Kiln which in fact works as a cooler for the high temperature gas. Heat that is
extracted from the hot gas is utilised in transforming water to high temperature – high pressure
Steam to run conventional condensing type Steam Turbo – Generator. There is a 25 MW Turbogenerator to be fed by 2 x 12 TPH and 2 x 38 TPH WHRB Boilers. The temperature and pressure
maintained in the boiler are 495°C and 66 kg/cm2
. It has been envisaged that the Captive Power
Plant will operate in synchronous mode with 132 kV grid of Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board.

The plant was commissioned 27/02/2006

“The project activity was previously registered as a UNFCCC CDM Project activity ID 06741
 until
2016. Under the UCR program, the project is now being considered for the crediting period from
01/01/2017.

There is no change in the start date of crediting period. The start date of crediting under UCR is
considered as 01/01/2017

1st monitoring period: 01/01/2017 to 31/12/2023 (07 Years)
